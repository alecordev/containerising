## Installation of webdriver

On Ubuntu, you could simply:

- `sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver`
- `sudo apt install firefox-geckodriver`

Another approach is automating the installation with this Python package:

- https://pypi.org/project/webdriver-manager/
- https://github.com/SergeyPirogov/webdriver_manager
